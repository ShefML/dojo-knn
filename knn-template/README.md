This is scaffold for your knn implementation.

If you're not sure where to start, this provides a number of functions to implement.

A sample implementation can be found in `../python` if you get stuck.

The test `./knn-test.py` will check that you `euclidian_distance` function behaves correctly
for a couple of simple examples. Run it with `python -m unittest knn-test`
